## Grading the Unit 2 Final

Students should submit their final by providing a github url to their forked
copy of this repository.  At that URL, click on `Actions` and then click on the
most recent workflow run.  Click on `Maven Tests` on the left navigation area,
and you will be presented with an overview of test passes/failures for various
end points that the student was to provide for this project.

You should note the percentage of tests that passed and use the grading
criteria below to assess the student's understanding of the topics covered in
this module.

## Grading Criteria

The student's understanding of java, Spring Boot, and RESTful services will be

## Additional Notes

Test file contents in the `src/test/java/` directory may be verified against
the main repository to ensure that the student did not modify the tests to
pass.  The main repository is located at
